## **Features**
- Extends "Radio New Vegas" with 200+ lore friendly tracks, retaining Mr. New Vegas and the original music of the game
-  Changes all world radios and jukeboxes that use "Mojave Radio" to "Radio New Vegas" allowing you to hear the new music naturally as well as on the Pip-Boy
- All tracks have been normalized to keep audio levels in-line 

## **Music**
- Featuring music primarily from the 50's and 60's, I tried my best to preserve the original style and feel of the original game while expanding on the selection of music
