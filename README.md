Featuring music primarily from the '50s and '60s, I tried my best to preserve the original style and feel of the original game while expanding on the selection of music. According to Joshua Sawyer, the cutoff point for the music in-game was JFK's death in '63. I tried my best to stick to this but made some exceptions where I felt like it would be appropriate.

* **Can I uninstall this mid-playthrough?** 
    * Yes! I've tested it myself and it's fine. Just make sure to turn off the radio and leave any cell that might have an active radio playing in it.
* **This song doesn't fit, how can I remove it?**
    * Open an issue and I'll look at removing it or try compiling yourself with Jarol's tool, linked below.
